A negative number is any number that is less than zero. For instance, -7 is a number that is seven less than 0.
It might seem a little odd to say that a number is less than 0. After all, we often think of zero as meaning nothing. For instance, if you have 0 pieces of chocolate left in your candy bowl, you have no candy. There's nothing left. It's difficult to imagine having less than nothing in this case.
However, there are instances in real life where you use numbers that are less than zero. For example, have you ever been outside on a really cold winter day when the temperature was below zero? Any temperature below zero is a negative number. For instance, the temperature on this thermometer is -20, or twenty degrees below zero.
